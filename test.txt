Consider that for a moment
everything we see around us is assumed to have had a cause and i
contingent upon something else. However, when it comes to existen
itself, it takes on the opposite. I
s mind boggling to think tha
something has always been and always will be. It goes contrary t
what we experience in our lives. But somehow, i
s possible. I
also implies that cause is a misnomer: if existence is eternal
then cause is not all that important. Existence, without a beginning or end
continues to change its form. In addition, the concept of time has to be thrown o
as well if we consider the nature of the universe. Without a beginning or end t
existence, time is rendered irrelevant. Sure, it is a useful tool in our daily live
but it is not a universal fact. Time is just our perception of duration within an eternal univers
An essential question is why existence is boundless. We can say,
that is the way it is

especially for someone who is inquisitive. Well, the human mind deals i
duality in order to perceive the world, and we think if we were born, then the universe must have had 
beginning (Parvez, Hanan). But the universe does
t have to conform to the human mind. We are often to
egocentric to see past our limited capabilities. In fact, you and I were never bor

and the entire universe shrinks to the size of a single atom, Hawking said. This subatomic ball of everythin
is known as the singularity (not to be confused with the technological singularity during which artificia
intelligence will overtake humans). Inside this extremely small, massively dense speck of heat and energy
the laws of physics and time as we know them cease to functio

Stephen Hawking is quoted as saying,
It was always reaching closer to nothing but did
t become nothing
There was never a Big Bang that produced something from nothing. It just seemed that way from mankin
